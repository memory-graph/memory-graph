- Preserved for strategic thinking reference

### PHASE4_RELATIONSHIP_SYSTEM.md
**Status**: Archived (completed phase documentation)
**Purpose**: Detailed Phase 4 completion report
**Reference**: Links updated to point to `completed_phases.md#phase-4`

## Using This Archive

### When to Use Archived Docs
- Understanding historical design decisions
- Reviewing completed phase implementations
- Researching original planning rationale
- Comparing original plan vs actual implementation

### When NOT to Use Archived Docs
- **Current work**: Use `/docs/WORKPLAN.md` instead
- **Feature documentation**: Use main `/docs` directory
- **API reference**: Use current API docs
- **Setup guides**: Use current setup documentation
