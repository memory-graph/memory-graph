# MemoryGraph Workplan Index

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-08
**Current Version**: v0.10.0 (ready for release)
**Test Status**: 1,068 tests passing
**Purpose**: Central index for all workplans organized by priority and dependency

> **Note**: Completed and deprecated workplans have been moved to `/docs/archive/` for reference.

## ⚠️ Context Budget Principle (2025-12-07)

**Every MCP tool must justify its context overhead.**

| Metric | Budget |
|--------|--------|
| MCP tool definition | ~1-1.5k tokens each |
| Current total (Core) | ~9.6k tokens (9 tools) |
| Current total (Extended) | ~11k tokens (12 tools) |
| Target overhead | <15% of context window |

### Before Adding New MCP Tools

1. **Estimate cost**: ~1-1.5k tokens per tool
2. **Evaluate uniqueness**: Does this duplicate existing functionality?
3. **Assess frequency**: Expected usage > 10% of sessions?
4. **Calculate ROI**: value / context_cost > 0.5

### Recent Decisions

- **12-WORKPLAN**: Cut 5/6 navigation tools (saved ~5.5k tokens)
- **13-WORKPLAN**: MCP tools deferred pending usage review

---

## Parallel Execution Summary

Each workplan includes a **Parallel Execution Guide** for running with multiple agents.

| Workplan | Max Parallel Agents | Parallelizable Sections |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **WP0 (Marketing)** | 4 agents | Discovery channels, launch posts |
| **WP6 (Multi-Tenancy)** | 3 agents | Config, backend indexes |
| **WP16 (SDK)** | 4 agents | LlamaIndex, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen |
| **WP20 (Cloud)** | ✅ Complete | N/A |
| **WP21 (LadybugDB)** | 2 agents | Query/Search, Relationships |

### How to Use Parallel Agents

1. Read the **Parallel Execution Guide** at the top of each workplan
2. Identify sections that can run simultaneously (no dependencies)
3. Launch agents with specific section assignments
4. Coordinate on shared files (models, config) before parallel phases

---

## Overview

Workplans are numbered and organized for sequential or parallel execution by coding agents. Each workplan is designed to be:
- **Readable in one session** (~130-500 lines)
- **Self-contained** with clear prerequisites
- **Actionable** with markdown checkboxes
- **File-specific** with absolute paths where relevant
- **Context-aware** with MCP tool budgets considered
- **Parallelizable** with dependency graphs for multi-agent execution

## Execution Recommendations

### For Coding Agents

**v0.10.0 Track (Competitive Features)**:
1. Start with **12-WORKPLAN** (Semantic Navigation) - validates our graph-first approach
2. Then **13-WORKPLAN** (Bi-Temporal Schema) - learn from Graphiti
3. Release v0.10.0 with both features

**v1.0.0 Track (Cloud Launch)**:
1. Start with **14-WORKPLAN** (Cloud Infrastructure) - foundation for everything
2. Then **15-WORKPLAN** (Authentication) - critical for cloud
3. Parallel: **16-WORKPLAN** (SDK) and **17-WORKPLAN** (Website)
4. Release v1.0.0 with cloud platform live

**v1.1.0 Track (Team Features)**:
1. After v1.0.0 launched, work on **18-WORKPLAN** (Team Sync)
2. Release v1.1.0 with real-time collaboration

**Parallel Execution**:
- **0-WORKPLAN-MARKETING**: Can run in parallel with ALL development work
- **16-WORKPLAN** and **17-WORKPLAN**: Can be worked on in parallel
- **6-WORKPLAN**: Defer until multi-tenancy is needed (enterprise customers)
