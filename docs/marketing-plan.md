## PR Template for Awesome Lists

Use this when submitting to GitHub awesome lists:

```markdown
## Add claude-code-memory to Memory section

### Description
Claude Code Memory is a graph-based MCP memory server that provides intelligent,
relationship-aware memory for Claude Code and other MCP clients. Unlike vector-based
memory, it uses graph databases (Neo4j, Memgraph, or SQLite) to capture how
information connects.

### Key Features
- **Zero-config installation**: `pip install memorygraphMCP` with SQLite default
- **Three deployment modes**: lite (8 tools), standard (17 tools), full (44 tools)
- **Graph-based storage**: Captures relationships between memories
- **Pattern recognition**: Learns from past solutions and decisions
- **Multi-backend support**: SQLite (default), Neo4j, Memgraph
- **Docker deployment**: One-command setup for all modes
- **93% test coverage**: Production-ready with 401 passing tests

### Why Add This?
This server uses graph relationships to understand *how* information connects,
enabling queries like:
- "What solutions worked for similar problems?"
- "What decisions led to this outcome?"
- "What patterns exist across my projects?"

Perfect for developers using Claude Code who want persistent, intelligent memory.
